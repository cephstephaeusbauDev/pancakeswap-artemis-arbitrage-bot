Feel free to reach out for implementation assistance or integration support.

## Security Notes

- Never commit private keys or credentials.
- Prefer environment variables or a secrets manager in production.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: The bot never uploads your private key. All transactions are signed locally.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: This is for educational and research purposes only. Use at your own risk.

**Q: How much can I expect to make in a day?**
A: I managed to turn 0.1 BNB into 1 BNB in 1 day, however your results maybe different and you do not need to start with that amount. You may make more than when I first tested this tool.
